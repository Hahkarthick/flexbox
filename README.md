# Flexbox

The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").

# Flex Container

src: MDN
CSS Flexible Box Layout is a module of CSS that defines a CSS box model optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated.

# Flex Justify-content

This defines the alignment along the main axis.

justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;

Flex-start : Pack items from the start
Flex-end  : Pack items from the end 
Center     : Pack items around the center
Space-between : Distribute the items evenly and space between the items
Space-around : Distribute the items Items have a half-size space  on either end
Space-evenly : Distribute items evenly Items have equal space around them
